I am a second year master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am interested in building scalable natural language processing models for social good. Actively working on AI for Mental Health and Adversarial Question Authoring. I am skilled in C++, Python, JAVA, Hadoop, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning algorithms, and Data Structures.

I want to pursue a PhD program with a focus on building and using Natural Language Processing techniques for social good. During my ongoing Masterâ€™s program at Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects that use language processing for betterment of online mental health platforms. This has equipped me with a strong foundation of computational social science methods along with a well-rounded experience of working with popular language processing algorithms. Working in a highly motivated research environment full-time in a PhD program will give me a chance to lead innovation for safe and inclusive online communities by building equitable technology, all the while learning from the best professors and research groups in the world.
