<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am interested in building human-AI collaborative natural language processing models for social good. I am skilled in C++, Python, JAVA, Hadoop, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning algorithms, and Data Structures.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I want to pursue a Ph.D. program with a focus on understanding the human behavioral alignment of language models and their impact on social decision-making. During my Masterâ€™s program at Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects that use language processing for the betterment of online mental health platforms. This has equipped me with a strong foundation of computational social science methods along with a well-rounded experience of working with popular language processing algorithms.
