<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am interested in building humman-AI collaborative natural language processing models for social good. I am skilled in C++, Python, JAVA, Hadoop, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning algorithms, and Data Structures.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I want to pursue a PhD program with a focus on building Human-AI collaborative Natural Language Processing techniques as models become pervasive. During my Masterâ€™s program at Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects that use language processing for betterment of online mental health platforms. This has equipped me with a strong foundation of computational social science methods along with a well-rounded experience of working with popular language processing algorithms.
